# AlumTrack
The AlumTrack is a platform designed to connect and track the activities of alumni from an educational institution. This website provides features for alumni search, user profile management, user validation, and a blue tick verification feature. The goal is to facilitate networking and engagement among alumni while ensuring the authenticity of user profiles.

# Features
Alumni Search: The website offers a search functionality that allows users to find specific alumni based on various criteria such as name, graduation year, location, profession, and more. This feature enables alumni to connect with each other and explore potential networking opportunities.

User Profile Management: Registered users can create and manage their profiles on the website. They can provide details about their education, employment history, achievements, and contact information. Users can update their profiles as needed and control the visibility of certain information.

User Validation: To maintain the integrity of the platform, user validation mechanisms are implemented. New user registrations can be subject to an approval process by administrators to ensure that only legitimate alumni are granted access. User accounts may require verification through email or other methods to confirm their association with the educational institution.

Blue Tick Verification: The website provides a special "blue tick" verification feature for notable alumni or individuals who have achieved recognition in their respective fields. The blue tick serves as a visual indicator of verified profiles, providing authenticity and credibility to those users.

Engagement and Networking: The platform encourages alumni to engage with each other through features like group discussions, and event notifications. Alumni can connect with old classmates, share career advice, organize reunions, and participate in professional or social events organized by the institution.

Privacy and Security: The website ensures the privacy and security of user data. Personal information is stored securely, and users have control over the visibility of their profiles and data.
